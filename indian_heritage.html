    <p>Indian word for culture is ‘Sanskriti’. From time immemorial, Indians have described their culture as 
        ‘Human Culture’ (Manav Dharma/ Sanskriti). It has a universal appeal. The principle of ‘Unity in Diversity’ is the implicit law of nature, universe and life. People belonging to diverse communities, speaking different languages, having different food, performing different customs harmoniously co-exist in India. Thus, the soul of cultural heritage of India lies in the fact that 
        it’s an all embracing confluence of religions, traditions, customs and beliefs.</p>
    <p>Over the years, numerous styles of art, architecture, painting, music, dance, festivals and customs have developed in India and this wide variety has made the Indian culture unparalled to which the entire world still looks up to. The cultural heritage of India still flourishes maintaining 
            its original features together along with changes,a key indicator of its strength.</p>

<p>The population of India is around 1.4 billion which contributes a major part in the entire world’s population.
     These people belong to various religions and ethnicities.India, being a secular country respects multiple religions including Hindu, Muslim, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and many more.
      However, the population of Hindu followers is much more than any other.Religion is one of the governing forces that rule Indian people because a major section of our population has faith in some or the other religion, especially Hinduism.
     It is impossible to understand Indian culture without learning about its religion which has a large impact on people.
     The religions of India have deep historical roots in the form of texts and epics. Indian people engage in some or the other sort of religious activities in daily life.</p><br>

     <p>India is a land of diversification. Every state has its unique art, culture and tradition.
         The one thing that is common for all states is the celebration of individual culture and tradition.
         Indians celebrate their beliefs, culture and tradition in the form of festivals. 
         Every festival has its own specific characteristics. 
         Festivals in India are celebrated season-wise and state-wise.</p>
    <ol type="1">
     <li>Makar Sankranti</li>
     <p>Makar(a) Sankranti (Sanskrit: मकरसङ्क्रान्ति, romanized: Makarasaṅkrānti), also referred to as Uttarayana, Makar, or simply Sankranti, is a Hindu observance and a festival. Usually falling on the date of January 15 annually,
         this occasion marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara).</p>

         <li>Holi</li>
    <p>Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/) is a popular and significant Hindu festival 
        celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love and Spring.It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the god Radha and Krishna.
        Additionally, the day also signifies the triumph of good over evil, 
        as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over Hiranyakashipu.</p>
    <li>Id-ul-fitar</li>
    <p>Eid al-Fitr (/ˌiːd əl ˈfɪtər, -trə/; Arabic: عيد الفطر, romanized) Eid al-Fiṭr, lit. 'Holiday of Breaking the Fast', or the Festival of Sweets 
        is the earlier of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Adha).</p>
 </ol>
 <font color="brown" face="Times New Roman" size="5"><b>CUISINE</b></font>
 <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. 
    Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, 
    these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
    Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.
    Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain 
    foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a 
    number of new vegetables and fruit to India. 
    A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava 
    have become staples in many regions of India.</p>
